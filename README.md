[CVPR 2024 Accepted] Task-Driven Exploration: Decoupling and Inter-Task Feedback for Joint Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection

# Task-Driven Exploration: Decoupling and Inter-Task Feedback for Joint Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection

[Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09263)
### Introduction
This code repo implements TaskWeave in _CVPR 2024_, the first attempt to explore the task-driven paradigm for joint Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection. In this paper, we present the first task-driven top-down framework, named TaskWeave. We introduce a task-decoupled unit to capture task-specific and common representations. To further investigate the interactions between these two tasks, we propose an inter-task feedback mechanism. It transforms the results of one task into guiding masks to assist the other task. Lastly, different from existing methods, we present a task-dependent joint loss function to optimize the model. As far as we are aware, this is the first framework to address this joint task from the task-centric perspective. Comprehensive experiments and in-depth ablation studies on QVHighlights, TVSum, and Charades-STA datasets corroborate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed framework.
